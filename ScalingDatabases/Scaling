Read replica - able to scale up as many as needed
- all data from master is in read replica
- read only from application standpoint because it writes from master


Reddis - piece of data structure that has been deployed 
Cache tend be fast 5x faster than hard drive, store data in RAM

CDN useful because it takes off of load balancer

Cache

80 GBs data
350m 
21k/month

-> 210/month
2 millisecond to respond

LRU - Least Recently Usage

Cache - RAM -> data(file)
CDN - stores files, jpeg, html, json, etc


80/20 rule, if you take 20% of the data. (in theory data is 100gb). Duplicated read replicas, if i take 20% as a base figure

LRU = popularity, algorithm

dictionary is a blocked container that dictates to RAM
k = node double linked list -> class node value -> instantiate ->

k = ref node = ref data
